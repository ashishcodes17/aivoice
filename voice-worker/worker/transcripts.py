"""Tidy what the speech recognizer hands to the conversation.

Two real failures seen on live calls:
* Sarvam looped on noise, returning "లే లే లే ..." about 100 times in one turn, which then sat in
  the conversation and inflated every later request.
* Filler sounds ("అ", "ఉమ్", "ఏ ఏ.") were treated as full turns, so the agent answered them.
